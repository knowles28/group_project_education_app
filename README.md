## Brief

Below is the tailored brief we followed for the project:

**Abstract**

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or *prototype* to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. The target audience of the app will be adults.

**MVP**

A user should be able to:

- view educational content on global environmental topics
- view collections of different subjects and work through the pages to learn
- save progress on current learning e.g. mark a topic as read
- test their knowledge with interactive quizzes

**Extensions**

- [x] A dashboard that tracks the users learning with charts/graphs, based on their interactions with the website
- [x] Use new React libraries and components
- [ ] Use external api to show the user realtime information
- [x] Multiple users
- [ ] Allow users to share information through social media platforms




## Challenges

* File Structure / Naming Conventions
* Material UI version issues
* CSS, React & Material UI compatibility issues


## Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git.

git clone git@github.com:knowles28/group_project_education_app

**From Terminal:**

Once the download has ended, move into the directory named 'client' by running the following command:

  > cd client
  
Now to install all the modules for the client, run this command:

  > npm i
  
Deployment
To begin, you'll need to start up the backend server. Open your terminal and type the following commands:

  > cd client

  > npm run server:dev ??
  
Once the server is running, it's time to start up the front end. To do this, open your terminal in the main project directory, and move into the 'client' directory:

  > cd client
 
From 'client' run the following terminal command:

  > npm start
  
Verify it is running correctly by browsing http://localhost:3000
