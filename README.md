### Tech Stack

### Challenges

### Installation

Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git.

git clone git@github.com:knowles28/group_project_education_app

Once the download has ended, move into the directory named 'client' by running the following command:

  cd client
  
Now to install all the modules for the client, run this command:

  npm i
  
Deployment
To begin, you'll need to start up the backend server. Open your terminal and type the following command:

  npm run server:dev ??
  
Once the server is running, it's time to start up the front end. To do this, open your terminal in the main project directory, and move into the 'client' directory:

  cd client
From 'client' run the following terminal command:

  npm start
Verify it is running correctly by browsing http://localhost:3000
